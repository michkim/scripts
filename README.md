scripts to make my life easier

This system shell script prints out the first few (if any) running processes & their cpu usage of each network machine. 
Helpful in deciding which machine to ssh into.

You need the 2 files in this directory:
cpu.sh and getCpuInfo.sh

Execute this one:  cpu.sh (edit the path on the first line)
